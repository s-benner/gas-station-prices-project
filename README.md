# gas-station-prices-project
Let's see if I can find something out about when it is the best time to fill up my car's tank

## Project goal
When it comes to gasoline prices, a lot of people seem to to hunt for the last cent, even is that "costs" more money than is actually saved at the end. Further, I often hear people talk about when the best time of the day or week is to fill up. But is that really so? I will use data analytics to try to shed some light on this topic.

## Tools
I will be using jupyter notebooks with python hosted on github for this project.

## Data
For this project, I will start from scratch and scrape the data myself. I will be scraping data for 1 month from the web, for gas stations in my home town Munich, Germany.

## Major findings
