# gas-station-prices-project
Let's see if I can find something out about when it is the best time to fill up my car's tank

## Project goal
When it comes to gasoline prices, a lot of people seem to hunt for the last cent by driving to the cheapest station nearby, even is that "costs" more money than is actually saved at the end. Further, I often hear people talk about when the best time of the day or week is to fill up, but everyone seems to have different opinions. So what to make out of that? I will use data analytics to try to shed some light on this topic by myself.

## Tools
I will be using jupyter notebooks with python hosted on github for this project.

## Data
The historical data is avalable from Tankerk√∂nig (https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de/). I used the database extracts from 2019 to begin ma analysis.

## Major findings
